## Projects
### Artificial Neural Network Turbofan Engine Degradation-Failure Prediction

Developed a predictive model utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines based on run-to-failure datasets. The project leveraged the **Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS)** dataset, provided by NASA Ames in collaboration with ETH Zurich and PARC, to train and validate the model.

Key aspects of the project:
- Processed multivariate time-series data representing a fleet of engines under varying operational conditions.
- Accounted for initial wear, manufacturing variations, and sensor noise to enhance model robustness.
- Implemented ANN-based prognostics to predict engine failure and optimize maintenance schedules.
- Improved predictive accuracy by analyzing operational settings affecting engine performance.

The model successfully estimated the RUL of test engines, demonstrating its potential for real-world aerospace applications in predictive maintenance and failure prevention.

### Field Instrument Calibration Decision Through Anomaly-Drift Detection Aggregation and Distributed Consensus Mechanism Validation Method

Developed an AI-powered calibration decision system to enhance the accuracy and reliability of industrial field instruments. The system aggregates multiple anomaly detection models into a distributed consensus mechanism, ensuring validated and verified data integrity across key instrument variables (flow, pressure, and level) in a circulating water system.

Key Aspect of the project:
- Designed a **miniature prototype** to simulate real-world calibration challenges.
- Implemented **AI-driven anomaly detection** using models such as LSTM, Local Outlier Factor, and Isolation Forest.

### Calibration Service Charges Payment Portal for Instrument Calibration Activity

This application is Service Charges Payment Portal for Instrument Calibration Activity. The idea of the program development is current conditions Instrument Calibration Service Provider worked based on centralized databases which are mostly working on manual validation. This program worked through validation of calibration report submitted by service provider to check and validate the calibration on spesification target with calibration validation value. If the calibration result is achieved, the service provider could automatically withdraw the service fee. To prevent unauthorized withdrawal, the application has been protected by authorization pin and public hash key address of the service provider/beneficiary.
